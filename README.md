# DB192IDC20

## A adapter for connecting a Apple UniDisk to an Apple Drive II card

A small adpater to connect an Apple UniDisk with an DB19 connector to a Apple Drive II interface card.
I only using this for an Apple II+, so there is no switching or any kind of drive detection circuits, just a straight pin to pin connection.

Parts.

1. 3D printed shell (Resin Print)
2. DB25F (for harvesting the pins)
3. IDC20 connector
4. PCB

Note. the shell is resin printed with Siraya Tech Blu.
